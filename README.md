#üì¶ Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm or Yarn

Backend Setup
Navigate into the server directory:

cd server

Install the backend dependencies:

npm install
or
yarn install

Create a .env file in the server directory and add your environment variables. Example:

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key

Replace placeholders with your actual values.

Start the backend server:

npm start
or
yarn start

Frontend Setup
Navigate into the client directory:

cd client

Install the frontend dependencies:

npm install
or
yarn install

If your frontend needs to connect to the backend, ensure your API base URL is correctly configured (e.g., in a .env file in the client directory, or within your React app's configuration). Example:

REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

Adjust the URL if your backend runs on a different port or domain.

Start the frontend development server:

npm start
or
yarn start

#üñ•Ô∏è Usage
Once both the backend and frontend servers are running:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or the port where your React app is running).

Register a new user account or log in if you already have one.

Explore the blog posts, create your own, like posts, add comments, and utilize the search functionality.
